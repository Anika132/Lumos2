Lumos Influencer discovery tool
Around half of Indian instagram influencers have fake followers!This frightened us. Brands and agencies are collaborating with influencers having huge follower-base, but when it comes to Earned Media Value (or whatever ROI metrics you use), the influencer generated content rarely generate value. To cope up with this, we are launching the beta version of Instagram influencer discovery tool to find quality influencers. This allows you to:
* Search influencers of all size, interest and geography,
* Shortlist and create your own lists of influencers with their contact point, 
* Measure the performance of influencers even from outside of our pool of influencers. (Just upload the list of influencers in .csv format and enter the campaign hashtag
